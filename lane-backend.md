# Back-end lane log

Working notes for the back-end lane: `backend/`, deployment, server contracts,
generated clients, and repository release tooling. Codex works this lane from
the primary worktree on `main`; Claude owns front-end behavior in
`.claude/worktrees/claude-lane`.

`PROJECT.md` remains authoritative for shared decisions, milestone state, and
acceptance gates. Detailed back-end checkpoints and front-end handoffs live
here so the two lanes do not repeatedly edit the same evidence paragraphs.

Last updated: 2026-09-10

## Current state

- M7-A's F02/F03/F04 implementation and a real-PostGIS read-versus-swipe
  regression are present. Docker and physical-device acceptance remain open.
- F01's signup and method-aware join protections are implemented. Real gateway
  proof and the Cloudflare connector trust decision remain open.
- F13 and F30 are complete. F14's session/enrollment revocation implementation
  is complete but its Postgres concurrency/replay cases await Docker; F20
  atomic admin mutations is the next back-end checkpoint.
- Claude completed the F17 client convergence half in `6277dcd`, and the
  additive deck-free server progress contract is ready for client integration.

## Checkpoints

### F14 privileged-session revocation — implemented (2026-09-10)

The JWT manager remains compatible with Serverpod's JWT refresh endpoint but
adds one targeted state lookup after signature/expiry validation whenever an
access token carries `admin` or `admin-enrollment`. The existing refresh-token
row is the session record: logout or any token-manager revocation deletes it,
so a copied privileged access JWT fails on its next authentication check.
Anonymous consumer JWTs deliberately keep the existing stateless validation
path.

Passkey registration atomically deletes-and-claims the enrollment refresh row
inside the same transaction that consumes the challenge and inserts the
credential. A failed ceremony rolls the claim back; concurrent ceremonies can
commit only one claim. Successful registration also broadcasts the existing
revocation notification after commit.

Five focused unit tests pass. Three real-Postgres cases cover copied admin-token
replay, the stateless anonymous path, claim rollback, and concurrent one-time
consumption. They compile with fatal-info analysis, but cannot execute because
this host has no Docker command. Pinned full preflight passes 111 server tests,
123 app tests, nine admin tests, generation/formatting, all analyses, and
repository checks. The signed `0.2.1+7` APK and alias remain 104,876,403 bytes
at SHA-256
`34091e6b6eac5a2663e9cd5b2c9b1ffbc5ae879966710afc29aa4a14ec9276d2`;
both manifests, package/version metadata, and APK Signature Scheme v2 verify.

### F13 passkey UP/UV enforcement — complete (2026-09-10)

The server now parses registration attestation authenticator data and validates
login authenticator data before delegating to Serverpod's existing ceremony.
Both paths require the configured RP hash, the 37-byte minimum authenticator
structure, signed user presence, and signed user verification. Existing
origin/type, challenge, key-ID, and signature checks remain in force. Signature
counter zero remains accepted for synced passkeys.

Targeted regressions cover malformed and wrong-RP data, each missing flag on
registration, and valid ES256 login signatures whose signed authenticator data
has UP=false or UV=false. The tests first prove the pinned dependency accepts
those inputs, then prove Hayer's policy rejects them.

Verification: pinned full preflight passes generation/formatting, all fatal-
info analyses, 106 server tests, 123 app tests, nine admin tests, and repository
checks. The required signed `0.2.1+7` APK and alias are 104,876,403 bytes at
SHA-256
`34091e6b6eac5a2663e9cd5b2c9b1ffbc5ae879966710afc29aa4a14ec9276d2`;
both manifests, package/version metadata, and APK Signature Scheme v2 verify.
A supervised real-authenticator registration/login ceremony remains a release
gate.

### F30 recovery credentials stay out of logs — complete (2026-09-09)

First-time runtime initialization now requires a preprovisioned
`HAYER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` and fails closed when it is absent. Once
`admin.htpasswd` exists in the persistent gateway secret volume, restarts no
longer require the environment value. The initializer result and command no
longer carry or print a generated recovery password.

Deployment guidance tells the operator to supply the initial value through the
protected Unraid configuration, store it offline, and remove it from the
runtime environment after initialization. Targeted tests cover first-start
failure, configured initialization, secret preservation, and the absence of
credential-printing code.

Verification: pinned full preflight passes generation/formatting, all fatal-
info analyses, 103 server tests, 123 app tests, nine admin tests, and repository
checks. The required signed `0.2.1+7` APK and alias are 104,876,403 bytes at
SHA-256
`34091e6b6eac5a2663e9cd5b2c9b1ffbc5ae879966710afc29aa4a14ec9276d2`;
both manifests, package/version metadata, and APK Signature Scheme v2 verify.

### F01 method-aware join budget — implemented (2026-09-09)

`hayerSession.join` retains its 30-request/minute authenticated-user budget and
now also applies a 120-request/minute budget to the client address vouched for
by the gateway. Requests without that header fall back to the direct peer, so
direct-origin access cannot spend a legitimate forwarded client's budget.

The per-client ceiling allows more than twice the entire 50-person beta to join
within one minute behind a carrier NAT while bounding attacks that rotate among
previously-created anonymous identities. The endpoint itself owns this check
because every Serverpod session RPC shares `/api/hayerSession` at the gateway.

The real-PostGIS regression uses distinct authenticated identities sharing the
test peer and proves the 121st join attempt is rejected by the client budget.
Live proof of forwarded addresses, forged headers, and direct-origin behavior
still requires the production-like gateway/container environment.

Verification: pinned full preflight passes generation/formatting, all fatal-
info analyses, 101 server tests, 123 app tests, nine admin tests, shell checks,
and diff checks. The new integration case compiles but cannot run because this
host has no Docker command. The required signed `0.2.1+7` APK and alias are
104,876,403 bytes at SHA-256
`0ac17018b52c8685eaa783836bb2c79da44ff1fe9ba1af5e35cf6c0a7da7de0f`;
both manifests and APK Signature Scheme v2 verify. The backend-only change
correctly leaves the APK bytes unchanged from the prior P06 build.

## Open handoffs to the front-end lane

### F17 lightweight progress contract — back-end complete (2026-09-09)

The additive `hayerSession.progress` method returns the mutable session view,
participants, explicit caller, per-place aggregate vote tallies, and destination
choice state. It carries place IDs but no `PlaceSnapshot`, precise location,
address, photos, or other immutable deck fields. Existing `load` remains intact
for initial/bootstrap reads and old clients.

The read holds a shared room lock so concurrent progress readers do not block
each other while all revision-changing mutations remain serialized. Expiry is
an authorized, parameterized conditional update of only status/revision.
Presence writes are narrow and throttled to once per 30 seconds on this path.
The watch handshake now reads this state instead of loading and discarding the
entire deck before emitting its initial revision.

The real-PostGIS case proves caller authorization, updated aggregate counts,
and that serialized progress omits a known deck place name. It compiles under
fatal-info analysis but cannot run without Docker. Pinned full preflight passes
101 server tests, 123 app tests, nine admin tests, all analyses, generation,
formatting, and repository checks. The required signed `0.2.1+7` APK and alias
are 104,876,403 bytes at SHA-256
`34091e6b6eac5a2663e9cd5b2c9b1ffbc5ae879966710afc29aa4a14ec9276d2`;
both manifests, package/version metadata, and APK Signature Scheme v2 verify.

Claude handoff: rebase this commit, use full `load` only to acquire the deck,
then merge `progress` by `placeId` during real-time refresh. Preserve a full-
load fallback for an older server/rollback until the server-first rollout is
accepted. `resultTallies` deliberately omit rank; re-sort the retained result
snapshots using the existing result ordering after merging counts.
